        My name is Jackson Uptain. I've been coding for around a year and a half and have enjoyed every bit of it. Recently I've taken some time away from developing software so I could learn some ethical-hacking techniques/tools.

        Originally I started on my mom's computer, taking a few courses from Codecademy. I really enjoyed it and spent lots of time that summer working on it. After a few weeks, I learned how to use a framework called A-Frame, a 3D tool (built on top of ThreeJS).
        <br>
        <br>
        Over the months, I learned about ThreeJS and spent lots of time developing a multiplayer 3D environment. It was in no way professional, but I enjoyed it and learned from many, many mistakes. After that, I spent lots of time working on ethical-hacking projects and DIY RaspberryPi projects.

        I have enjoyed my time coding and will continue to do so. -Jackson Uptain
